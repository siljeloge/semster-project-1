        <br>
        to making science accessible to all.</h2>

        <h3>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself. 
          <br> <br>
          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us. 
          <br> <br>
          We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. 
          <br> <br>
          Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).</h3>

                <p>It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this exciting ‘space’.
                    Like "Commercial Space Travel", "Space Colonization" and "Satellite Internet".

                <img src="images/energetica.jpg" alt="squared sphere" id="energetica">
                <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. 
                From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.</p>

                <img src="images/nightinmuseum.jpg" alt="the museum with low lights" id="nightinmuseum">
                <p>Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders of science.
                    As the clock strikes midnight, the museum’s exhibits start to move. Paintings whisper secrets, ancient statues step off their pedestals, and historical figures come to life, eager to share their stories. But this isn’t just a regular tour — it’s a challenge.
                    Working together, the guests must complete a compilation of challenges, combining knowledge they’ve gathered from the different wings of the museum.
