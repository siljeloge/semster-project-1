This is my semester project for the first semester in Frontend-developing at Noroff.
For my first semester project, I was to design and make a website for a museum called "Community Science Museum". The target audience are 7-15 year old, as well as for teachers and researchers. I was given the information and photos that the "customer" wanted to include, but the rest was up for me to decide.

<h1>Description</h1>
This project were supposed to simulate an actual request from a customer, where were to come up with the design, as well as code it with HTML and CSS. First I did some research on different museum-websites, just to get a sense of how the layouts and colors were used. Since this was primarily for kids, I wanted to use playful colors, kind of futuristic fonts to represent the museum-vibe and filled the website with informative photos provided by the "customer".
I designed the website in Figma, where I also designed the logo. Then I started with the HTML-files, CSS and mediaqueries. 
The page includes:

- Informative index.html with dynamic photos
  
- Thumbnail with different exhibitions
  
- Contactform
