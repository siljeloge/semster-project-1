This is my semester project for the first semester in Frontend-developing at Noroff.
For my first semester project, I was to design and make a website for a museum called "Community Science Museum". The target audience are 7-15 year old, as well as teachers and researchers. I was given the information and photos that the "customer" wanted to include, but the rest was up to me.
